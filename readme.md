opusgap
=======

Converts WAV to perfectly gapless Opus.

It works, but it's not configurable and it doesn't support many formats.

Usage
-----

There are no command-line options.

Try `ls *.wav | ./opusgap` in a Unix-like shell.

Try `dir /b *.wav | opusgap` in Command Prompt.

Try `ls -Name *.wav | .\opusgap` in PowerShell.
